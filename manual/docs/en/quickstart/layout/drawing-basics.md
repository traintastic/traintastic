# Quick start: Drawing basics

In Traintastic, schematics are drawn on a **board**.
A board is like a canvas where you place track, turnouts, signals, and other objects to create a diagram that represents your physical railway.
You can create multiple boards, for example one for the **main layout** and another for the **hidden yard**.

## Step 1: Open the board list

1. Make sure you are in **edit mode** (![pencil](../../assets/images/icons/light/edit.png#only-light)![pencil](../../assets/images/icons/dark/edit.png#only-dark) button in the top right).
2. Open the board list:
    - From the main menu: **Objects → Boards**
    - Or click the ![board](../../assets/images/icons/light/board.png#only-light)![board](../../assets/images/icons/dark/board.png#only-dark) button on the toolbar.

## Step 2: Create a new board

1. In the board list, click the ![plus](../../assets/images/icons/light/add.png#only-light)![plus](../../assets/images/icons/dark/add.png#only-dark) button to create a new board.
2. The **Board setup wizard** opens.
   Currently it asks only for a **board name** (e.g. *Main Layout* or *Hidden Yard*).
3. Finish the wizard to setup your board.

You can now start drawing.

## Step 3: Place and rotate tiles

1. Select a **tile** from the toolbar (straight, curve, turnout, etc.).
2. Click on the board where you want to place it.
3. To **rotate** a tile (before placing it):
    - **Right-click** — rotate clockwise
    - ++shift++ + **Right-click** — rotate counter-clockwise

## Step 4: Move tiles

1. On the toolbar, select ![move](../../assets/images/icons/light/move_tile.png#only-light)![move](../../assets/images/icons/dark/move_tile.png#only-dark).
2. Click on the tile you want to move.
   The tile will follow your mouse cursor.
3. Click again to place it in the new location.
    - Rotation works the same as when placing a tile.
    - To cancel moving, press ++esc++.

## Step 5: Resize tiles

Some tiles, such as blocks, can be **resized** to change their length.

1. On the toolbar, select ![resize](../../assets/images/icons/light/resize_tile.png#only-light)![resize](../../assets/images/icons/dark/resize_tile.png#only-dark).
2. Click on the tile you want to resize.
3. Drag the edge to increase or decrease its length.

## Step 6: Delete tiles

1. On the toolbar, select ![bin](../../assets/images/icons/light/delete.png#only-light)![bin](../../assets/images/icons/dark/delete.png#only-dark).
2. Click on the tile you want to remove.
   The tile will be deleted immediately.

With these basics you can start sketching your layout, adjusting as you go.

!!! tip
    If your layout is large, start by drawing just a **small portion** first.
    This helps you get familiar with the board editor before creating the full schematic.


Here’s a **simple example layout**:

We’ll use this layout in the next pages to explain how to setup **turnout control**, **blocks and sensors**, and **signals**.

# Quick start: Create a schematic layout

To operate trains realistically in Traintastic, you need a **schematic drawing** of your model railway.
The schematic is where you place tracks, turnouts, blocks, sensors, and signals — and where you will later operate your trains.

This section of the quick start guide shows the **basics** of creating a schematic layout.
Each page covers one topic step by step:

1. [Drawing basics](drawing-basics.md) — learn how to place track segments and build your first schematic.
2. [Turnout control](turnouts.md) — add turnouts and connect them to your command station for remote control.
3. [Blocks and sensors](blocks-sensors.md) — divide the layout into blocks and use sensors for train detection.
4. [Signals](signals.md) — place signals and link them with blocks and turnouts for safe operation.

    These pages only cover the essentials to get you started.

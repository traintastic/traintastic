# Interface configuration

Traintastic supports a wide range of digital command stations, feedback sensors, and wireless throttle devices.
This section provides detailed instructions on configuring each supported interface for advanced users who need more control or whose setup is not fully covered by the setup wizard.

For a complete list of tested and supported hardware, see the [Supported hardware](../../appendix/supported-hardware/index.md) section.

## Overview

## Using the Setup Wizard

Whenever possible, use the **setup wizard** to add and configure interfaces.
The wizard guides you through a step by step setup and applies recommended settings.
This is the preferred method for most users.

## Manual Configuration

Some interfaces, custom setups, or advanced features may require **manual configuration**.
Each page in this section provides step-by-step instructions, including:

- Interface requirements and limitations
- Connection and setup procedures
- Recommended settings and troubleshooting tips

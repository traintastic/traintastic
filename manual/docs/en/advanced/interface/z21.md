# Z21 interface configuration

This page describes how to configure a Z21 command station in Traintastic.

!!! tip
    The Z21 can be added using the **setup wizard**, which guides you through the process step by step.
    See [Quick start: Connect to your command station](../../quickstart/command-station.md) for details.

## Supported connection types

Z21 command stations can only be connected to Traintastic over the network.
All Z21 variants — **z21 start**, **z21 white**, and **Z21 black** — use the same configuration.

## Connection settings

- **Hostname** – IP address or hostname of the Z21 command station (e.g., `192.168.0.111`).
- **Port** – UDP port number. Default is **21105** and normally should not be changed.

## Z21 settings

Additional options:

### Debugging

- **Debug log RX/TX** – Log all Z21 traffic (hex + description).

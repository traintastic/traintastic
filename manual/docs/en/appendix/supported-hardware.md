# Supported hardware

This page lists command stations and digital systems that have been tested with Traintastic.
Using the setup wizard is **recommended** whenever possible.
If wizard support is not available, setup can still be done manually by creating and configuring the correct interface type.

For details on manual interface configuration, see the [Interface configuration](../advanced/interface/index.md) section.

!!! tip "Not on the list?"
    Your system may still work even if it isn’t listed here.
    Visit the [community forum](https://discourse.traintastic.org) to see if others have tried it, or share your own experience to help extend this list.

# Supported smart boosters

This page lists **smart boosters** that are supported by Traintastic.

Smart boosters are boosters that provide **status reporting** and/or **remote control**,
for example enabling or disabling a power district using an accessory (turnout) address.

Basic boosters without feedback or control are not listed here, as they do not expose additional
functionality to Traintastic.

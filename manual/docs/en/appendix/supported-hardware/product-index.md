# Hardware product index

This page lists hardware products for which Traintastic provides **specific notes, configuration details,
or device-specific behavior**.

It is **not** a complete list of all hardware that works with Traintastic.

Many devices, such as standard DCC accessory decoders for turnouts or signals,
do not require dedicated documentation and work automatically when connected through
a supported command station.

Use this index if:

- you own a specific device and want to check whether special setup or notes apply, or
- you are looking for detailed information about advanced or smart hardware.

!!! note
    Absence from this list does **not** imply that a device is unsupported.
    Only hardware with documented configuration steps or special behavior is included here.

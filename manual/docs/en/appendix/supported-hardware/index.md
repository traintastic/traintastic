# Supported hardware (overview)

This section provides an overview of hardware that has been **tested and verified** with Traintastic.
It helps you determine whether your hardware is supported and what level of integration is available.

## Hardware categories

- **[Command stations](command-stations/index.md)** – central control units and digital systems
- **[Smart boosters](boosters/index.md)** – boosters with feedback or remote control

If you are looking for documentation for a specific device without knowing its category,
see the **[Hardware product index](product-index.md)**.

## Community and vendor collaboration

!!! note "Not on the list?"
    Your hardware may still work even if it isn’t listed here.
    Check the [community forum](https://discourse.traintastic.org) to see if others have tested it, or share your own experience.

!!! info "Hardware vendors"
    Traintastic actively welcomes collaboration with hardware manufacturers.
    If you are a vendor interested in supporting your products,
    please contact **Reinder Feenstra** (project maintainer) via email at

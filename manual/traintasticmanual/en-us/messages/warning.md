## W2002: Command station doesn't support functions above F*number* {#w2002}

**Cause:** The command station or interface can't control these function, e.g. due hardware or protocol limitations.

**Solution:** Check if command station is setup properly, some command stations have options which specify how to control additional functions.
If not, remapping decoder functions or using a different command station is the only solution.


## W2003: Command station doesn't support *number* speed steps, using *number* {#w2003}

**Cause:** The command station or interface can't control decoders using *number* speed steps, e.g. due hardware or protocol limitations.

**Solution:** The number of speed steps that can be used is determinded by the command station or interface. Changing the decoders speed steps to *Auto* should usally work.
